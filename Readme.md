My Legacy App

This is a toy example of a legacy ASP.NET MVC app with three layers - controller, service class, repository. There are no tests and lots of hard dependencies such as database, smtp and writing to a file.

The aim is to create the needed unit tests for this project (you can ignore the integration tests, although those would be needed as well in real life). This will require some careful refactoring to make the code testable first.

Good luck!
